# Language_Identificaiton

This repository present a python script that uses a deep learning library called HugginFance (https://huggingface.co/) that group different pre-trained 
model for several topics. The model used named 'xlm-roberta-base-language-detection' which is a fine-tuned version of xlm-roberta-base on the Language 
Identification dataset.
This model is an XLM-RoBERTa transformer model with a classification head on top (i.e. a linear layer on top of the pooled output). 
For additional information please refer to the xlm-roberta-base model card or to the paper Unsupervised Cross-lingual Representation Learning at 
Scale by Conneau et al.
